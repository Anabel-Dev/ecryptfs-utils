Description: To encrypt your home directory or "Private" folder, a strong
 passphrase has been automatically generated. Usually your directory is unlocked
 with your user password, but if you ever need to manually recover this
 directory, you will need this passphrase. Please print or write it down and
 store it in a safe location!
 .
 Click "Run this action now" to either:
  (1) enter your LOGIN password at the "Passphrase" prompt to display
      and manually record your randomly generated MOUNT passphrase, or

      (or compatible) key escrow service in the Cloud.
