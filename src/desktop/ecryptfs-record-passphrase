_Description:
 To encrypt your home directory or "Private" folder, a strong
 passphrase has been autogenerated. Usually your directory is unlocked
 with your user password, but if you ever need to manually recover this
 directory, you will need this passphrase. Please print or write it down and
 store it in a safe location.
 .
 You can run the "ecryptfs-unwrap-passphrase" command now to do this. Enter
 your user password at the "Passphrase" prompt.
