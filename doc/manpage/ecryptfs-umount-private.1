\fBecryptfs-umount-private\fP

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBecryptfs-umount-private\fP is a wrapper script for the \fBumount.ecryptfs_private\fP utility.  It only unmounts if ~/.ecryptfs/auto-umount exists and if there are 1 or 0 instances of this user on the system, as reported by the \fBwho\fP(1) utility.  It also ensures that ~/.Private has 500 permissions after the unmount.
