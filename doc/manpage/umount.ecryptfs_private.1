umount.ecryptfs_private \- eCryptfs private unmount helper.

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBumount.ecryptfs_private\fP

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBumount.ecryptfs_private\fP is a mount helper utility for non-root users to unmount a cryptographically mounted private directory, ~/Private.

If, and only if:
  - the private mount passphrase is in their kernel keyring, and
  - the current user owns both ~/.Private and ~/Private, and
  - ~/.Private is currently mounted on ~/Private

This program will:
  - unmount ~/Private

The only setuid operationis in this program are the call to \fBumount\fP and updating \fB/etc/mtab\fP.

The system administrator can add the pam_ecryptfs.so module to the PAM stack and automatically perform the unmount on logout. See \fBpam_ecryptfs\fP(8).

.SH FILES
\fI~/.Private\fP - underlying directory containing encrypted data
